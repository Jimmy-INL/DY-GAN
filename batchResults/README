You can run findBest.sh right out of the box and that should work so long as the format of logs.txt is:

===================================
epoch 500 trial <> StatsScore <> MLLKSStatistic <> MLLKSPval <> METPhiKSStatistic <> METPhiKSPval <> Lep1IsoKSStatistic <> Lep1IsoKSPval <>
epoch 1000 trial <> StatsScore <> MLLKSStatistic <> MLLKSPval <> METPhiKSStatistic <> METPhiKSPval <> Lep1IsoKSStatistic <> Lep1IsoKSPval <>
....
===================================

It's robust against any other log output so long as it doesn't have the string: MLLKSStatistic 

Change the options at the top of findBest.sh first, everything should be output to results/

You can grab a result by running ./showResult.sh 
Change the LogDir and RunKey in the file first.
